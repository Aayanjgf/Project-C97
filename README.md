# Project-C97
1. Student and Adults having problems in reading - An app where words are broken in chunks. 

2. Student and Adult having concentration defects - Brain Game App.
      In this modern world, we all know that memory and concentration defects are becoming common. Due to this I've decided to create an Super Fun Brain Developing App
        that would help everyone to focus on a particular task. In this app, there would be super fun interesting puzzles, cage-blocker games and games that use critical thinking to improve the memory and concentration. 
      
3. Students having problem with Timetable - Timetable reminder App.
4. Problems faced by blind persons - Helping Blind Braille App.
